# 🎾 Ball Throwing Device for Animals

This Arduino-based project implements an interactive ball throwing device designed to entertain pets, especially when their human companions are unavailable. The system integrates distance sensing, visual/auditory feedback, and a servo-driven catapult mechanism, offering a smart and automated play experience.

## 🚀 Features

- 📏 **Ultrasonic Distance Sensing**: Measures if the pet is within interaction range
- 🎯 **Condition-based Activation**: Throws a ball only if distance ≥ 10 cm and button is pressed
- 💡 **LED Indicators**:
  - Green: Ready to throw
  - Red: Distance too short
- 🔊 **Auditory Feedback**: Buzzer emits a 1000Hz tone upon triggering
- 🤖 **Servo Motor Control**: Smooth 90-degree catapult launch and reset
- 🛠️ **Physical Components**: Includes button input, LEDs, servo, buzzer, and HC-SR04 sensor

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Arduino UNO R3** – Microcontroller board
- **C/C++** – For Arduino logic and control
- **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)** – Distance detection
- **Servo Motor (MG995)** – Ball launching mechanism
- **Breadboard + Resistors + LEDs + Button + Buzzer** – Circuit design
- **Wokwi** – Online circuit simulation

## 🛠️ Hardware Overview

The device consists of:
- A button for initiating throws
- An ultrasonic sensor for safe-range detection
- A buzzer for auditory signaling
- Two LEDs for visual feedback
- A servo motor that triggers the ball-launching mechanism

---

## 💻 How It Works

1. The ultrasonic sensor checks for distance ≥ 10 cm.
2. Green LED lights up if in range, red if too close.
3. When the button is pressed **and** the distance condition is met:
   - The servo motor rotates 90° to launch.
   - A buzzer sounds for 0.5 seconds.
   - The servo resets to its initial position.
